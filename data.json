    "description": "Dera Jaipur is an elegant heritage home built in 1946 and is a leafy paradise in the heart of the World Heritage UNESCO city of Jaipur. It is a classic home furnished for modern times, with beautiful lawns and terrace gardens. This heritage home steeped in the past belonged to a World War II veteran Col. Sumer Singh MBE and his wife Suraj Kunwar, who came from an erstwhile nobility of Shekhawati in Rajasthan. The region and the home are filled with frescoes. The family has a 500-year-old history and has had two generations in the Indian Armed Forces. Dera Jaipur is adorned with splendid frescoes, Burma teak furniture, Murano chandeliers, and vintage photographs. We pride ourselves in conjuring up delectable dishes, some of which are family heirlooms.",
